SOLID principles

// Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class should have one reason to change.
// Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
// Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
// Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
// Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
