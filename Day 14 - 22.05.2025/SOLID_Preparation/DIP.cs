/*
1. Start with a Clear Definition of DIP
"The Dependency Inversion Principle states:
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
And: Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions."

2. Walk Through Your Code Using That Definition
"In this example:

ManageEmployee is the high-level module — it controls the workflow for managing employees.

EmployeeRepository is the low-level module — it handles data access.

But neither directly depends on the other.

Instead, they both rely on abstractions:

ManageEmployee depends on IEmployeeService

EmployeeService depends on IRepository<int, Employee>

This decouples the system, allowing individual parts to be replaced or modified independently."

3. Explain Why This Is Beneficial
"This design offers flexibility:

I can swap EmployeeRepository with a mock or in-memory implementation for testing.

I can create different versions of IEmployeeService depending on business needs.

The high-level logic doesn’t need to know how the data layer works—it just calls the interface."

4. Show How It's Implemented (Code-Backed Explanation)
"Here’s how DIP is applied in code:

EmployeeRepository is created and assigned to a variable of type IRepository<int, Employee>.

It is injected into EmployeeService, which is stored as IEmployeeService.

ManageEmployee receives the service through its constructor, depending only on the abstraction.

This demonstrates Dependency Inversion: high-level logic (ManageEmployee) does not directly rely on low-level logic (EmployeeRepository), but both are connected through interfaces."

5. Mention Real-World Advantages
"In real-world projects:

It improves testability — I can use fake repositories for unit testing.

It enhances maintainability — switching from SQL Server to MongoDB, for example, only requires a new repository implementation.

It aligns with SOLID principles and results in better architecture over time."

Summary
"This example follows the Dependency Inversion Principle because every layer interacts through abstractions, not concrete classes. That decouples the components, improves testability, and allows for flexible and scalable design."
