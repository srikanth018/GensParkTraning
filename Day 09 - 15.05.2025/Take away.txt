another SP to insert 

comparing 

----------------------

password encryption can be done in 2 ways 
    1. SCRAM-SHA-256 (SCRAM- Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism)

OpenPGP (RFC 4880) standard.



Major aspects of security:
Authentication and authorization,
access control,
encryption,
auditing


--> pg_hba.conf file is the authentication file in the PostgreSQL
md5 -> simple hash
scram -> advanced hash


in the PostgreSQL console:
create role readonly login password 'rol123';
create database sample;
grant connect on database sample to readonly;
grant select on all tables in schema public to readonly; --> grant the authorization to the user readonly


in the bin >
psql -U readonly -d sample -p 5433



in the PostgreSQL console:
grant connect on database sample to readonly

revoke connect on database sample from readonly;
