Docker:

Transfer project from local to client:
    1. Through web server with IPs
    2. Through docker images
If we and client system have different versions of dependency, then it will throw version compatability error

docker hub:
    Having images

Virtual machines

Docker has its own hosting systems
Image -> when we deploy a application an image is created

Image creates Containers 

Docker Daemon needs linux based commands

docker --version
docker info
docker ps -> to show the containers
docker images -> to show the images

build, push, pull, run -> client can do these operations on images

swam -> for security in docker images
every container have its own isolation to enable security

Easily enable load balancing

dotnet run -> runing an image it creates container

docker ps -> list running containers

docker ps -a -> list all containers

docker rm <containerId> -> remove the container

Alpine -> Linux like environment image
       -> we can execute linux commands

docker run -it alpine /bin/sh -> command to execute the Alpine environment in the terminal, it opens a interactive terminal we can use that to run linux commands
            -> i stands for interactive
            -> t stands for sudo terminal
            -> alpine image name
            -> /bin/sh where it executes the terminal

docker stop <containerId> -> to stop the running container

Note: If you want to remove the container, you should stop the container if it is running

Noted: If you want to remove the image, first you should remove the container of that image

docker rmi <imageId> -> removes the image

docker rm <containerId> -> remove the container

docker log -> logs the actions that we have done so for

Perging:
Prune -> conatiner prune, image prune, network prune, volume prune
