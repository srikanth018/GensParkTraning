Docker Files Concept
Create and execute docker files

How to create our own docker image:
    1. create Folder with index.html file
    2. create server.js
    3. create a docker file (did't have any extention for file simply name the file should be "Dockerfile")

Dokerfile contents:

'#' -> for comments

FROM -> keyword to fetch image

WORKDIR -> create the work directory

curl -> helps to make http call from command promt

RUN apt-get update -> update all outdated things

statement1 &&\ statement1 
&&\ -> to execute one after another

apt-get install -y curl -> saying yes to install all

COPY . . -> copying the required files

EXPOSE 3000 -> expose the port

CMD("node" "server.js") -> execute the server file

Build a image for our docker file:

Name your image:
docker build -t simple-app . => this '.' used to mention the director of the docker file

-t -> tag name
-y -> yes to install

by default cache is enable -> let if there are 4 steps the docker executing and when it fails at step 3, it caches the previous the 2 steps.
