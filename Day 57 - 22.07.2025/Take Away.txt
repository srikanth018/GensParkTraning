CI/CD pipe line:

DevOps -> Developmet and Operation
we create devops pipepline

Deployment Process:
souce code --> Version Control --> compilation --> testing --> Quality gate --> Quality check --> Release --> View Application

To automates these proces we write scripts.
once we commit the code in the verion control it triggers the flow one by one 

Pipeline -> CI/CD - the entire flow
stages -> A big step - Build/Test
Job -> A group of task in a stage 
Task -> A singlr command - Restore / Build
 
we do write scripts in yaml file to do the piple flow

Create pipeline:
    1. Through Azure pipeline
    2. Through YAML file
