Singleton -> a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

make default constructor as private

create a static method which creates the instance => This method either creates a new object or returns an existing one if it has already been created

why method is static?
    we can't able to create instance or object to that class, static method get called without the instance



Factory Method =>  provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
