Unit Testing:

Filters in .net -> Search google 

Setup and TearDown Methods should be written in each file

Setup -> executes before testcases
TearDown -> Executes after test cases completed

Moq -> Is framework for mocking the dependencies
Mock<<dependency>> dependencyName = new(); --> Creating the dummy instance for the dependency need for that specific service layer for unit testing
