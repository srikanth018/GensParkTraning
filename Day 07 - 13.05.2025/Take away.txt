Locking Mechanism
PostgreSQL automatically applies locks, but you can control them manually when needed.

Types of Locks

MVCC VS Locks
MVCC allows readers and writers to work together without blocking.
Locks are needed when multiple writers try to touch the same row or table.

Simple Rule of Locks
Readers don‚Äôt block each other.
Writers block other writers on the same row.

two types of locks
 1. Row level
 2. Table level

Row-Level Locking (Default Behavior) / Implicit Lock
Two Users updating the same row

-- Table-Level Locks / Explicit Table Lock
1. ACCESS SHARE -- select
-- Allows reads and writes

2. ROW SHARE
-- SELECT ... FOR UPDATE -> lock the selected row for later update

3. EXCLUSIVE
-- Blocks writes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) but allows reads (SELECT)

4. ACCESS EXCLUSIVE  -- Most agressive lock 
-- Blocks everything, Used by ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE, 
-- Internally used by DDL.

Types of locks:

üîí Lock Type           Meaning                                  Blocks?
--------------------  ----------------------------------------  -------------------------
Row-Level Lock        Locks a specific row (during UPDATE/DELETE)  Other writers, not readers
Table-Level Lock      Locks the whole table                      Depends on mode
Advisory Lock         User-defined lock (custom)                 Depends

Action               MVCC Behavior                          Locking Behavior
-------------------  -------------------------------------  -------------------------------------
Reader vs. Reader    Never blocks (reads old snapshots)     Usually doesn‚Äôt block
Writer vs. Reader    Doesn‚Äôt block (reader sees old version) Reader might wait if writer locks
Writer vs. Writer    Can block (only one can commit)        Blocks (both fight for lock)

Types of lock modes in table level locks

Lock Mode             Blocks Reads?    Blocks Writes?
--------------------  ---------------  ----------------
ACCESS SHARE          ‚ùå No             ‚ùå No
ROW SHARE             ‚ùå No             ‚ùå No
EXCLUSIVE             ‚ùå No             ‚úÖ Yes
ACCESS EXCLUSIVE      ‚úÖ Yes            ‚úÖ Yes




Triggers:

Set of statements which executes automatically when a modification in the table, like while insert/update/delete

example:
after insert in a table log the inserted information in the log table automatically

In PostgreSQL only, Trigger implementation should be in a function
first write a function what the trigger should do and that function should return a trigger
then create the trigger and call the function 

OLD/NEW:

Temporary tables were created as OLD/NEW and get dropped when trigger completes

Cursor:

steps:
 declare
 open
 fetch(loop)
 close
 deallocate
